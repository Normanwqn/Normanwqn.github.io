							<p> Pierre-Simon Laplace was a French scholar in the 18th century whose work contributed significantly to the development of engineering, mathematics and physics at that time. He was often referred to as the "French Netwon" during that period of time. Similar to Newton and many other of his contemporaries, he believed that the world is fundamentally <strong> deterministic</strong> meaning that we can ultimately trace the past of a system and further predict its future. Hence he propsed the theory of "Laplace's Demon" which suggested that if one knows the precise location and momentum of every atom in the universe, the past and future events can be known by prediction.</p>
							
						
							<p class="lead">Chaos Theory directly challenges the idea of determinism. Even though assuming that we can determine how each system behaves accurately. The small <strong> variation in initial conditions</strong> will dramatically affect the accuracy of the prediction due to the lurking <strong>nonlinearity</strong>.</p>
							
						  <h2>Nonlinearity</h2>
							<p class = "lead">Even though we are able to predict behaviour of dynamical system somehow accurately by using differential equations, these chaotic dynamical system often exhibit non-linear behaviour. It means that a miniscule variation in the initial conditions of the system will lead to dramatically different results.</p>
							<p>A double pendulum is a chaotic system as shown in the previous article. The following video/simulation will show that small differences in initial state of the system will gradually amplified into dramatic differences.

						  <p class="lead">In 1961, when Edward Lorenz was attempting to devise weather prediction model, he was the first to notice the patterns of nonlinearity change when he proposed a system of differential equations (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorenz_system">Lorenz System</a>) to model atmospheric convection. $$\eqalign{& {{dx} \over {dt}} = \sigma (y - x)  \cr & {{dy} \over {dt}} = x(\rho  - z) - y  \cr & {{dz} \over {dt}} = xy - \beta z \cr} $$</p>
							<p> σ, ρ and β represents the Prandtl number, Rayleigh number, and certain physical dimensions of the layer itself <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaos_theory">(Wikipedia)</a>. However, it is more widely applicable to model behaviour of lasers, DC motors, chemical reactions, etc. Its "mathematical properties" far more interesting than what the exact meaning of each parameter is.</p>
						  <p>When Lorenz first tried to solve the system of differential equations, he tried to plot its various solutions using an analogue computer Royal McBee LGP-30 (digital computers were a rarities back then). He once stopped a simulation halfway and to save time he resumed it by manually reinputing the data the print-out data 0.506 which is rounded to 3-digits instead of the actual mid-way value 0.506127. To his surprise, the result is dramatically different from what is expected.</p>

							<p>The above excerpt was how Edward Lorenz initially spotted the nonlinearity patterns.</p>
							<p> Here is a modern simulation of nonlinearity: <i>(Source: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97ryBYOTQ0o">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97ryBYOTQ0o</a>)</i></p>

							<p class="lead"> The <span style="color:rgba(82,191,191,1.00)">blue</span> and <span style="color:rgba(245,233,19,1.00)">yellow</span> points were initially extremely similar states but over time they ended at completely different branches.</p>
							<p>Hence, there is the term "the Butterfly Effect". A small variation in the conditions of the weather such as the flapping of the wings of a butterfly can potentially lead to unexpected dramatic changes further away (in Lorenz's original analogy the change is formation of a tornado). Even though Lorenz's model is said to be a toy model, it exposes the vulnerability of a making predictions using a nonlinear deterministic system - <strong>chaos</strong>. </p>
							<p>In a 1963 paper, Lorenz essentially concluded that "the systems in that model could only be predicted up to a specific point in the future, and beyond that, reducing the error in the initial conditions would not increase the predictability". Hence a chaotic deterministic system could be "observationally indistinguishable" from a probabilistic system. (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butterfly_effect">Source</a>)</p>
							<p class="lead">Chaos Theory hence contributed to the demise of Laplace's Demon by arguing that deterministic systems are practically Not "Chaotic" Chaos. Hence, we cannot know for 100% whether it is going to rain tomorrow, whereas we just assign a probability of precipitation.</p>
