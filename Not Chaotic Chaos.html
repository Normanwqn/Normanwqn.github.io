							<p class="lead">Chaos is not necessary chaotic. Real life dynamical system does not necessarily appear to be so chaotic. One possible explanation of this phenomenon is the existence of "attractors". </p>

						  <p class="lead">Here, initially there are various dramtically different states spread out throughout the phase space. However, under the Lorenz System of Differntial Equations, all these states are "attracted" to the "Butterfly shape" structure which is referred to as <strong>the Loren'z Attractor</strong>. </p>
						
						  <p>"An <strong>attractor</strong> is a set of numerical values toward which a system tend to evolve. It describes the behaviour of a dynamical system. As mentioned, a dynamical system is often described by system of differential equations. These differential equation describe physical phenomenon incorporate dissipoative elements such as friction, heat losses, etc. Hence, it is often that these systems lose energy over time and cease their motion. Chaos theory are concerned about the sensivity to the initial conditions. However, the difference in the intiail conditions would be flatten out due to the dissipative forces. In some sense, these systems are are attracted to the state of the cease in motion. Hence, such kind of pattern is referred to as <strong> attractors</strong>.</p>

						<p class="lead">We have seen the third graph which is the phase diagram of a pendulum. Pendulums also act under the influence of attractors as they converge towards one final state which is the cease in motion.</p>
						<p> In some sense, gravity is an attractor. When objects of differnet initial states enter a gravity well, they will eventually settle down on the bottom of the gravity well. Hence, as time passes, when they there is variance in initial conditions, we can accurately predict the end state of the system due to the presence of the attractor.</p>

						  <p>Lorenz attractor is one of the many <strong>strange attractors</strong>. Strange attractors are said to be attractors of fractal dimensions. Strange attractors are different from other phase-space attractors in that one does not know exactly where on the attractor the system will be. <a href="http://www.stsci.edu/~lbradley/seminar/attractors">Source: http://www.stsci.edu/~lbradley/seminar/attractors</a></p>
						<p> There are other types of attractors which also arose from the study of chaotic dynamical systems. For instance, the <strong> Rössler</strong> attractor is devised by Otto Rössler in 1976 to study oscillations in chemical reactions. Their equations similar to the Lorenz's attractor look deceivingly simple. </p>
							<p>$$\eqalign{& {{dx} \over {dt}} =  - y - z  \cr & {{dy} \over {dt}} = x + ay  \cr & {{dz} \over {dt}} = b + z(x - c) \cr} $$</p>
							<p>If we keeping parameters b and c constant and changing the value of a, when a is approximately 0.3, its behaviour becomes increasingly chaotic. Source: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R%C3%B6ssler_attractor">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R%C3%B6ssler_attractor</a> </p>

							<p>An interesting phenomenon occurs when its behaviour is chaotic. It is proven that it is possible to "fold" a Rössler attractor into a Mobius Strip around its <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poincar%C3%A9_map">Poincaré section</a> (unfortunately this is an interesting topology topic related to Chaos theory that I am not unable to fully understand).</p>

							<p class="lead">Nevertheless, we can also witness the effects of a Rössler Attractor similar to the Lorenz Attractor as it converges seemingly random system states in a <strong>"not chaotic"</strong> pattern.</p>
